Hi, yeah, it’s me, bec/Becca, Press, Puzzle Club President, that very tired-looking person at the beginning of the kickoff video and the even more tired person at the beginning of wrapup.

I joined Death & Mayhem right after Mystery Hunt 2024, when they put out a call for students. I had really no clue what I’d gotten myself into.

## My puzzles

I co-authored 3 puzzles throughout the year, drew art for 1, and testsolved idk how many. I’ve listed them here with their code names because up until about a week before hunt, that was how we referred to them, and that’s how they stuck in my brain.

Maze of Lies (unfit-tower): Denis proposed a knights and knaves type puzzle during spring retreat — I ended up writing the sudoku part and he the knights and knaves part, and we decided to make it a text adventure instead of just giving the map. This happened so early on and went smoothly enough that I don’t have many core memories about this except finally getting to play the text adventure on the website several months later.

Unreal Islands (whirlwind-saturn): I don’t even remember how we got the idea for this, but I wanted to write a logic puzzle with Atul, and we somehow stumbled down a wikipedia rabbithole for phantom islands (we went down a lot of wikipedia rabbitholes this year). So, we combined that with the most thematically close logic puzzle we could think of, Nurikabe. I’m used to having to come up with CURSED extractions for logic puzzles, so having the phantom islands as an extraction was pretty smooth in comparison. The original version of the puzzle had looked like a slanted hashtag and I believe had some intended flavortext backstory about social media-ing fake locations. Our editor-turned-coauthor, Henry, suggested just making it a ghost shape and adapted it into a very cute one, which became the final version.

Sounds Like a Dodo to Me (waterlogged-kiwi): I also don’t quite remember why we were on this website, but at some point we had found out all of MIT’s old course catalogs are all public. I literally spent a night just reading through early course catalogs and pointing out funny things to Atul and James. (We also found out that CJ had *conveniently* posted an article about this to the admissions blog two years prior, the morning of that year’s hunt.) We wanted to write a puzzle that made solvers go through the interesting things in the old catalogs, so we landed on an idea about diary entries set in a time period that solvers had to identify. Around the same time, Michele had loosely proposed a runaround puzzle concept to us, so we decided to combine them\! We wrote a couple initial entries — I had a very carefully worded one about James Michael Curley (read his wikipedia page and I think you’ll get the idea) — our James \[thankfully\] shot that idea down. I really love learning about MIT and Boston history, so I have a lot of regrets about not being able to spend more time on this puzzle, but alas, I had to pass my finals. Atul ended up finishing the rest of the diary entries after his final projects. I also wish more teams got to see/solve this puzzle, but one of the many highlights of Hunt weekend was a Providence student we knew coming over to the press table in Gala Saturday night, showing us his step count, and complaining about how much walking he had to do for this puzzle, not knowing who wrote it, while Atul, I, and the single remaining brain cell between us were dying laughing.

Relief Printing (messy-olive): I only did the art for this one, which took SEVERAL iterations of getting perfect colors, dimensions, and clear enough drawings (thanks to the authors and editors for putting up with me while I took forever on that). Also, I know it’s not that impressive, but as a non-frequent-digital-artist, I’m pretty proud of the texture brushes I ended up making for this.

The puzzles I testsolved were a mix of in-person at worksessions and retreats, and online. I probably can’t tell very interesting stories about every single testsolve session, but there were some highlights. I testsolved a certain meta at one worksession – our group realized we could identify a possibly concerning number of MIT floor tiles and benches from memory…….. I’m so sorry to the one non-MIT member of that testsolving group. We did end up splitting up the floors and ~~walking~~ running around campus with the authors and editors chasing us down. One particularly memorable testsolve day was when I was testing the Inspectre (very cute and almost therapeutic puzzle by the way, I ended up saving a copy for myself) – I had to stop myself from writing “this is much easier when you’re doing it with a Harvard math professor” in the testsolve comments (thanks Denis for compensating for my total inability to count). At the same time, there was a testsolve session for The Center is in Plain Sight (codename sinful-turkey) going on in the same room and one for Mellow Planet in the next room, so at some point we got to witness everyone devolving into chaos with “OH NO IT’S TESLA FETTUCCINEEE” and “WHY IS SINFUL-TURKEY SO SINFUL.”

Of course I always wish I could’ve written or testsolved or drawn or composed more, but there’s only so much time and energy I could’ve put into this, and as you can probably tell, there’s no upper bar to how much work can go into a Mystery Hunt. It’s bittersweet for sure, but I’m so happy with what we ended up with.

## Logistics and stuff

There were two MIT students officially on D\&M this year, though there were others like the rest of Puzzle Club exec and ex-exec, and the students who volunteered for Mystery Heist, who supported us in various ways throughout the year. Nearly every communication with any MIT admin or department was done by the two of us, so as you can probably imagine, a LOT of emails, calls, and meetings for an event of this magnitude, starting March of last year and ramping up through the year. The departments listed on my wrapup slides were only a subset of the people we worked with or reached out to. I basically spent all my extra time from winter finals season to hunt weekend jumping between admin emails, visits, and calls. As of writing this a few days after hunt, I have a folder of 3,756 emails just from people opening and signing media release docusigns, let alone the landslide of MH-related emails I actually needed to reply to. We used pretty much every registrar room available in the school, and many department-owned rooms as well. We still have a lot of thank yous to communicate, and financial stuff to deal with, and post-hunt meetings with admin to have, while we hand the torch off to the amazing students on Cardinality.

This all being said, I don’t mean to sound complain-y at all about the role of students on the writing team — I’m really, really grateful to everyone on admin who supported this event and gave us advice, and I think I speak for both me and Atul when I say we learned a LOT about the logistical and legal considerations when running an event of this size and chaos-ity. I just want to stress to future writing teams the staggering amount of logistical work that needs to happen, the importance of having multiple students, and that they need to be cognisant of the relationships with MIT those students need to maintain or build. I’m eternally grateful to Michele and Molly and everyone else on ops for all their work and how much easier they made this role for us.

## The weekend

I don’t even know how to start putting this in words. This weekend felt like a blur and also the most adrenaline-filled, best weekend of my life.

**THURSDAY**: We had team training Thursday — first puzzle-on-call training, then a full team meeting, then bartending and hint queue training, then Atul and I took a couple of D\&M’s international members on a tour of campus, and finally TTBNL’s How to Hunt workshop. Long day, I know, and hunt hadn’t even started yet. I think the highlight was when James marked on the whiteboard every time he mentioned a way we fucked ourselves over (the answer is a lot of times). A mark for not being able to chat about the weather or most sports, a mark for forcing teams to rename themselves to Spartacus such that we couldn’t even tell them apart, a mark for making the bartenders differentiate between the two instances each team had to ask to use the phone, and so so so SO much more.

**FRIDAY**: I got to HQ pretty early, where, naturally, we were still uploading and captioning the kickoff video our prod team had finished overnight \<3. Guys. I’m still in awe of the production quality of kickoff. I was there for filming (the head on the left in the audience), and I couldn’t have imagined how good the final video would’ve looked.

After kickoff, I returned to the now-set-up Gala (there should always be a color-changing bar there, it livens the place up so much), and settled into a few hours of fielding people wandering into Gala and obsessively checking the leaderboard.

I went on one round as Press to visit the dorm teams and then to help some teams move rooms — again, logistics for an event of this scale are NOT EASY. It was lovely getting to see a student on Wafflehaus figure out Songs on the Radio in front of me, and then funny? unfortunate? seeing the remote members of Frumious solve a meta in the 5 minutes I was moving their in-person members to another room. Also, my favorite hint to give (shoutout to John from Grad Unified for indulging me in this) was on Educational Rite of Passage — asking teams if they had any alumni with a brass rat and asking if there was any difference to how they were wearing theirs vs how I wear mine. Unrelated to puzzles, I ran into my research mentor in Stata a couple times in my very vintage dug-out-the-back-of-my-mom’s-closet costume and it just felt like a “this is the bullshit I do on weekends \<3” kind of moment.

**SATURDAY**: My morning shift Saturday turned into something like 6 AM \- 11 PM, oops… I woke up to texts from the students on Cardinality and Providence, who had stayed up through the night and were ranting to me about the puzzles they were stuck on. The whole day was such a blur, I can only word-dump a hodgepodge of stuff that happened. I visited the top 20 or so teams with James and Evan, hint-queued and press-ed and errata-checked and email-answered, listened to a *LOT* of Star Spangled Banners, moved a team after a power outage, and probably more I can’t remember right now. There was a great Sidecar memorial in Math and Vehem, other than that I did dozens of team visits over the weekend, and they all started blending together in my very sleep-deprived memory. I do distinctly remember two instances of Literally Animal Farm asking for hints near the end of the night — one person who said they’d worked on The Eras Puzzle for 24 hours (condolences, I’d probably go insane sorting through Taylor Swift setlists for a full day) and a group working on He Shouldn’t Have Eaten the Apple who had an incredibly detailed spreadsheet with all the relevant information and to whom my best advice ended up being “sort by columns until morale improves.” Two teams did ask if the Tiktok ban that I guess was in place for a few hours that day was at all going to affect any aspect of hunt – the answer is that apparently D\&M is old (and Atul, Elan, and I don’t use Tiktok) so no, none of our authors intended Tiktok as a required resource and none of our testsolvers even thought to use it. I had a great time watching bartender interactions as well, and really have to give props to the bartenders for embodying those roles and to all the hunters for playing along. Of course, I’d been watching the tight race between all the top teams throughout the day, but I have to admit at that point I didn’t feel like I had a great sense of how long teams were going to take to finish certain metas. I literally didn’t know if I could sleep that night, but I guess this was the silver lining to campus closing overnight. When I was heading home, I saw a lot of teams out checking benches, but also groups of (I think EC?) students leading around other blindfolded students around campus and had to ask D\&M to make sure it wasn’t a puzzle.

**SUNDAY**: Aaaand again, my morning shift turned into 6 AM \- 4 AM on Sunday. Again, a total blur of running between mild emergencies (facilities calls, finding their manager, emailing IS\&T over multiple things, dealing with locked rooms, uninstalling an escape room, dealing with an alarm that got set off…), listening to radio duets, more hint-queueing and press-ing and email-answering. After we were sure Cardinality was going to win, James and I visited all the top teams again to urge them to come to Gala, and then he basically gave us free reign to aggressively hint teams and try to push as many teams as possible (who wanted the help) to the finish. I watched Cardinality’s final interaction run – Cardinality’s troubles with the radio and having to send someone back to Le Meridien to grab it was such a blessing in disguise as I needed the stalling time to wake up Atul – there’s a whole ‘nother story there. I have to say I’m impressed they finished the interaction without talking in the final attempt. I don’t think we managed that in the testrun. My film music professor would be proud of them.

I then spent a bit of time with NES before returning to HQ, and then spent much of the afternoon helping teams in a now-very-crowded Gala. For this I have to shout out STA, half my hints to them were “pls read the flavortext” and ended up with me on the bernie meme. I was on such an adrenaline high until the teams I had hinted the most that day and ended up super invested in finished, and promptly crashed in the final interaction room. I only got a ten minute lie-down between NES and STA/Math and Vehem’s final interaction runs, but I swear to anyone who saw me lying on the ground in the vault room that we did not kill off another character.

Sunday was by far my favorite day of the weekend, and not just because teams finished. Gala was PACKED. If I have one regret, it was not doing more to encourage more people to go to Gala earlier. I really loved seeing everyone in one place, interacting with the Press and bartenders. We’re not going to pretend the race after Cardinality and Providence finished was a fair fight – I suppose it was fair in that everyone could ask for any hints they wanted from the Press – but our purpose that day turned into making sure people had as much fun as possible, whatever that may have meant for them. I’m really hoping we achieved that for a lot of hunters, and especially for our student participants.

After HQ closed that night, I visited another couple teams, whom I think finished overnight, and then sat in lobby 7 and talked with a friend until like 3:30 AM, when I did the math on when I needed to be awake to do my slides for wrapup and realized that the number of hours of sleep I could get didn’t add up to you know, not immediately getting sick after hunt. I don’t even know how I stayed up that late. I have some mildly deranged pictures of me in my vintage cocktail dress walking through a snowstorm that night. Adrenaline is an extraordinary drug, I guess.

**MONDAY**: So I got a total of 12 hours of sleep between kickoff and wrapup. Not really ideal. Somehow I had enough caffeine, sugar, and adrenaline in me to keep me from crashing yet. I do remember finishing our slides in the 20 minutes before wrapup literally with the audience filling in (again, if you haven’t noticed by now, we love procrastinating). I don’t remember a word I actually said, but I know James was awesome.

That evening, we had a D\&M “afterparty” where we just played pool and talked and finally relaxed. Compliments had been streaming in all day \[I’m sure there were complaints too, but what made it into our overheard-and-praise or memes-and-shitposts discord channels were mildly selective\], so we were all just having a good time, riding the high, and enjoying being with the team. It brought me back to something my middle school band teacher told us, that music and other bands would come and go in our lives, but it would never be with the exact same group of people that we’d grown attached to that year. I was fully crying (HAPPY TEARS FOR A GREAT YEAR I PROMISE) by the time I hugged everyone goodbye.

## Post-hunt and reflections

This is probably just one of many things I’m going to be writing in the days to come — info to pass on to future writing teams, infinite emails, whitepapers for puzzle club, and more. I’m probably not going to write much about things like the radio, and our hunt structure and story, as proud as we are of those. I have thoughts about them that might be relevant when I work on other hunts, but the real stories behind many of those details would be much better written by the people on D\&M who can actually claim them as their brain-child. It’s even hard to do my own experience justice here, there’s just so many stories, thoughts, and emotions from this year that can’t be properly expressed in a single writeup.

Even this writeup is only happening now after several days of staring at an empty doc that reflected back the emptiness I’ve been feeling. I ended up doing an escape room (shoutout Boxaroo and Fro for Storyteller’s Secret, you all should go do it\!\!\!) with Elan late Tuesday night, after a full day of staring at ceilings and obsessively checking the same few post-hunt discord channels and not knowing what to do with myself. I’m sure others on D\&M and past writing teams will concur: post-hunt depression is real. I’ve had a year of always having a mountain of puzzles to write, edit, test, or factcheck, art to draw, music to listen to or compose, and an ops to-do list of literally 100+ things — I don’t even know what life without Mystery Hunt is like anymore. We had such an incredible year and then weekend that everything else just seems… dull in comparison. Somehow, Michele asking Atul and I to send some post-hunt emails and visit an admin office on Wednesday, and then being on the Reddit AMA, felt like the real normal. Sure, I have other puzzle and non-puzzle projects I’m working on, and excited for, but Mystery Hunt was on a scale like no other, and these people made it a pretty special year.

MIT Mystery Hunt is special for all three words in its name. There are many, many AMAZING online puzzlehunts or puzzlehunts affiliated with other institutions out there, but there are aspects of MH that make it unique. This weekend, I saw 2500 people gather in person, including many alumni returning to campus and many hunters reuniting with old friends and making new ones, an atmosphere that I hope the Gala enhanced. MH is special for bringing these people together, for celebrating MIT culture, and also (perhaps less profoundly but still very importantly to us) as a platform for physical puzzles that might not otherwise have such reach. MIT is such a special place to me, where everyone is insanely talented, and have wild interests and knowledge and passions and collaborations at scales that sometimes seem unfathomable, all things I fell in love with at my CPW and still deeply love about this place. Writing and solving puzzles is often as much an exercise in human psychology as it is in the topic and/or mechanic it might use, and so they are a display of the differences and similarities that make us all interesting humans. I see Mystery Hunt as an ever-evolving fusion of what makes MIT special to so many of us and what I love about puzzles. I hope our Mystery Hunt was able to share all of that.

My time as an undergrad on a MH writing team is over, and I sure am not intending to let it happen again (James I KNOW, I HEAR YOU, I PROMISE), but there’s still a lot of unfinished things I have a year and a half left to do with Puzzle Club, and a number (a somehow constantly growing number?) of puzzle projects I’m involved in. A few days ago I decided to start a new puzzlehunt/MH team with Rai and Atul — if you’re curious about joining, reach out to me\!

So, finally… a huge thank you to Atul for literally everything we’ve done together this year, Denis and Henry for coauthoring with me, James and Michele for all your work and support and trust and putting up with bs and everything I’ve gotten to discuss with you, the 100 other people on D\&M I wish I could all write out blurbs for here that I’ve so, so loved working with, the rest of puzzle club exec and ex-exec for all your support, and the 5000 hunters out there who brought this weekend to life.
